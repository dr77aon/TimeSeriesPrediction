# Temperature and Pressure Prediction using LSTM

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict temperature and pressure trends from historical climate data. The model utilizes the Jena Climate 2009-2016 dataset to forecast future temperature and pressure values based on past observations.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Jena Climate 2009-2016 dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/tf-keras-datasets/jena_climate_2009_2016.csv.zip). It includes hourly weather data from 2009 to 2016.

The main objectives of this project were to:

- Analyze historical climate data to understand temperature and pressure trends.
- Develop an LSTM model to forecast future temperature and pressure values.

##Results
The LSTM model demonstrated strong performance in forecasting temperature and pressure trends, with predictions closely aligning with actual values and effectively capturing temperature trends over time.

##Future Work
Potential future enhancements include:

-Experimenting with different LSTM architectures and hyperparameters.
-Incorporating additional features for improved predictions.
-Extending the analysis to other weather variables or time periods.
